# Project 5 - Tumblr

Submitted by: Soraya Sardine

Tumblr is an app that provides an blog feed experience within the app. A table view has been set up with custom cells to display blog post data fetched from Rosanna Pansino's blog. Users can pull-to-refresh the table view to fetch the latest posts and update the feed. Tapping on a post cell will allow users to view the full post details and any associated media content like images or videos. The overall goal is to provide a familiar, visually appealing interface for browsing and consuming blog content similar to popular blogging platforms like Tumblr.

## Notes

The only challenge I faced while completing this app was getting the API to properly fetch data from a blog and figuring out how to make the refresh function work.
